(WIP, need to add ability to compare multiple in between splits and make the program more user friendly.) This is a program that will find the best true segment across a segment with a single split between.
To use, clone the repository and place the lss file you want to use in the same folder. 
Varibale "inBetweenSegmentName" needs to initialized with a String of the name of the in between split
Variable "endSegmentNam" needs to be initialized with a String of the name of the end split
Variable "lssFile" needs to be initialized with a String of the name of your lss file (including the .lss extension)
